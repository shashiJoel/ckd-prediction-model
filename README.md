# ckd-prediction-model
This project focuses on developing a machine learning–based system capable of predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) at an early stage using clinical and patient data. Early diagnosis of CKD is essential for preventing progression to end-stage renal disease and reducing long-term complications.
